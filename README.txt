# Assignment1se102-2018
This is my Iteration assignment for SE102 in S2 2018

Hi Amit And Rob!
(External Ref= Ara Tutors)
This is my assignment work all zipped up and iterated for you. 

A few things to keep in mind:
  - There are 6 iterations, 4 marked so far.
  - This was Version controlled on GITHUB. Excuse the weird git config files.
  - The repository is live at https://github.com/PSyCOhTOa/Assignment1se102-2018.
  - Iteration on github is labeled differently to the iterations in the file system. (I have made my iterations start at 0 like an array on github)
  - Iteration 5 and 6 was swapped at the last minute due to the request of development of a smart controller. There may be some invalid references, but the folder system is the final structure of my iteration
  - My source Files are Final! If you would like to see how each iteration was developed, you can view the different branches on github, labeled respectively. I dont have the file space on my storage and wanted to avoid confusion of my file system to stop writing on the wrong files
  - My styling uses grid. Please use chrome. 
  - I have included the json data in the root directory of this zip file.


Please contact me on my email if you have any problems.
